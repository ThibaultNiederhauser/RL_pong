    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, reinforcement learning has operated on \"tabular\" state spaces, e.g. \"State 1\", \"State 2\", \"State 3\" etc. However, many important and interesting reinforcement learning problems (like moving robot arms or playing Atari games) are based on either continuous or very high-dimensional state spaces (like robot joint angles or pixels). Deep neural networks constitute one method for learning a value function or policy from continuous and high-dimensional observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this miniproject, you will teach an agent to play the game [Pong](https://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/games/pong.html) from the PyGame Learning Environment. While it is possible to learn the task directly from screen pixel values as done by DQN on the Atari games, here we consider a simpler low-dimensional state space. The agent needs to control a paddle to hit a ball and drive it past it's opponent's paddle which is controlled by the computer. The state space is 7-dimensional and continuous, and consists of the following state variables:\n",
    "- player paddle's y position.\n",
    "- player paddle's velocity.\n",
    "- cpu paddle's y position.\n",
    "- ball's x position.\n",
    "- ball's y position.\n",
    "- ball's x velocity.\n",
    "- ball's y velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent can take one of two actions, accelerate up or accelerate down. The agent gets a reward of +1 when it scores a point, i.e, when it drives the ball past the computer-controlled paddle, and a reward of -1 when it loses a point. We define a game (or episode) to be over when either the agent (or the computer) scores 7 points, after which a new game is started. Because the episodes become very long once the agent learns to compete with its opponent, we stop training when the agent wins a certain number of games in a row (20 by default). You can change this parameter if you wish to further train and improve your agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Policy Gradient approaches to learn the task. In supervised learning tasks, the network generates a probability distribution over the outputs, and is trained to maximize the probability of a specific target output given an observation. In Policy Gradient methods, the network generates a probability distribution over actions, and is trained to maximize expected future rewards given an observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should remember that reinforcement learning is noisy! You may get different results from one trial to another, and sometimes simpler approaches will outperform more complicated ones. If you don't see any improvement, or unstable learning, double-check your model and try adjusting the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should have set up the CS456 virtual conda environment and installed the dependencies as described in the document [Miniprojects | Environment Setup and XOR exercise](https://moodle.epfl.ch/pluginfile.php/2024974/mod_resource/content/6/env_setup.pdf) published on moodle. You should launch this notebook from this environment, i.e. using the CS456 python 3 kernel.\n",
    "- For this miniproject you will also need to install [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about), Pillow, and the [PyGame Learning Environment](https://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/home.html). To do so, the easiest workflow to follow is:\n",
    "    - source activate ann_env\n",
    "    - pip3 install Pillow\n",
    "    - pip3 install pygame\n",
    "    - git clone https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment\n",
    "    - cd PyGame-Learning-Environment\n",
    "    - pip3 install -e .\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should know the concepts of \"policy\", \"policy gradient\", \"REINFORCE\", \"REINFORCE with baseline\". If you want to start and haven't seen these yet in class, read Sutton & Barto (2018) Chapter 13 (13.1-13.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will learn how to implement a policy gradient neural network using the REINFORCE algorithm.\n",
    "- You will learn how to implement baselines with a learned value network.\n",
    "- You will learn to be more patient :) Some fits may take your computer quite a bit of time; run them over night (or on an external server). If you have access to a GPU you can also use the [gpu support of tensorflow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) to speed up simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning is noisy! Normally one should average over multiple random seeds with the same parameters to really see the impact of a change to the model, but we won't do this due to time constraints. However, you should be able to see learning over time with every approach. If you don't see any improvement, or very unstable learning, double-check your model and try adjusting the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is (mostly) based on the figures you submit and your answers to the questions. Provide clear and concise answers respecting the indicated maximum length. Keep your code tidy, organised and commented to allow us (and yourself) to understand what is going on. All plots must have axes labels as well as legends and a title where needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The submitted notebook must be run by you!** We will only do random tests of your code and not re-run the full notebook. There will be fraud detection sessions at the end of the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your names\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before you start**: please enter your full name(s) in the field below."

In `_get_returns`, implement a baseline based on a moving average of the returns; it should only be in effect when the agent is constructed with the `baseline` keyword. In `train`, use `train_on_batch` to form one minibatch from all the experiences in an episode. \n",

    "ADDITIONAL NOTES: \n",
    "1. Positive rewards are very sparse in this task. If you're finding it hard to tell if your agent is learning at all, you have the option of giving the agent the additional \"shaping\" reward mentioned above by setting the `reward_shaping` argument to True when calling `run_experiment`. After your implementation is working, you can take off these \"training wheels\", and train only with the game rewards.\n",

This can introduce instability in learning that needs to be addressed with more advanced techniques, so we won't use it for this miniproject.
